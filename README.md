SpamHook, reinvented. This was long overdue.

## Features
- A nice WinForms GUI now, yay!
- A much better and easier to use commandline
- Complete rewrite in C#
- New icon!
- New name!

## How to use
[Download it from the Releases page](https://github.com/3reetop/sphk/releases/latest) and run either of the following:

**If you wish to use the GUI**: run `sphk_gui.exe`
or
**If you know your way around a command-line**: run `sphk.exe`

The GUI is really just a fancy wrapper for the command-line.
